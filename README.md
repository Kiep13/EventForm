# Salesforce Dynamic Event Form

This is project for learning how to work with FieldSet in modern Salesforce JavaScript Frameworks and objects, which doesn't supported in UI API

1. Need to create dynamic form for creating and editing Event object
2. Fields set for form must be created using Field Set option. Standard fields and their dependencies can skip.
3. Need to create different fields with different data types
4. Use LWC or Aura
